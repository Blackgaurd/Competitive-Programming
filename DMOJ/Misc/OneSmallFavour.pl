print "Hail the Dark Lord Quantum!"

> The Hat's thought was almost a whisper. *"I cannot speak of the others to you - but do you think that you are the first potential Dark Lord to pass under my brim? I cannot know the individual cases, but I can know this: Of those who did not intend evil from the very beginning, some of them listened to my warnings, and went to Houses where they would find happiness. And some of them... some of them did not."*

> That stopped Harry. But not for long. *And of those who did not heed the warning - did they all become Dark Lords? Or did some of them achieve greatness for good, as well? Just what are the exact percentages here?*

> *"I cannot give you exact statistics. I cannot know them so I cannot count them. I just know that your chances don't feel good. They feel very not-good."*

> *But I just wouldn't do that! Ever!*

> *"I know that I have heard that claim before."*

> *I am not Dark Lord material!*

> *"Yes, you are. You really, really are."*

> *Why? Just because I once thought it would be cool to have a legion of brainwashed followers chanting 'Hail the Dark Lord Harry'?*
