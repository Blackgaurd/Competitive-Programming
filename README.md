# Competitive-Programming

Spending way too much time on this.

## DMOJ

Problems found on dmoj.ca. Problems are grouped by contest. The 'Misc' folder holds any problem that I either forgot to organize or is not part of a contest.

## Codeforces

Problems found on codeforces.com. Problems are named according to their number on the website. Until I find a better way to organize these I will follow this convention.
