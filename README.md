Files are sorted by contest names.

Most of the problems are ones found on dmoj.ca

It is not guaranteed that all files will give a passing solution on dmoj.

Some of the java files may not have their names match up with the class name. This is due to renaming for organization. If you stumble upon one of these files, please raise an issue.

Currently working on putting problem names at the top of all CCC problems, and checking to see if they work.

Next step will be to organize by year.
