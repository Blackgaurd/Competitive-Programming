600+ competitive programming solutions with 24, 000+ lines of code in mainly C++, Python, and Java.

## DMOJ

Problems found on dmoj.ca. Problems are grouped by contest. The 'Misc' folder holds any problem that I either forgot to organize or is not part of a contest.

## Codeforces

Problems found on codeforces.com. Problems are named according to their number on the website. Until I find a better way to organize these I will follow this convention.

## C++ Files

Files written to work with c++14 with g++. There are some built-ins used that may not work on other compilers (e.g. `__gcd`).
